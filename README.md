I've successfully solved the 3x3x3x3 rubik tesseract.  
You can do it too!

This repo contains the logfile and macros that I  
submitted to superliminal to get into their hall of fame.  
See: http://superliminal.com/cube/halloffame.htm  

Please make sure you build the macros yourself, it  
is critical to your understanding of the cube.

These are the links I used:
